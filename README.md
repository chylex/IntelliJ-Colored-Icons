Adds color to many of the gray IntelliJ platform icons. Uses resources from https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community and some of the official IntelliJ platform plugins.

First release includes 176 updated icons. It should be compatible with *most* IDEs based on the IntelliJ platform. Please report any issues in particular IDEs, and any icons you would like to see changed.
